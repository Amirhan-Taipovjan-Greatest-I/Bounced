    as you've concerned, <strong>Bounced</strong> does nothing except make your Minecraft titles animated through an easing bouncing function, every time the titles are shown.
    <br />
    <br />
    This mod is too simple to have a config, and if you don't like the animations, just delete the mod. If you like it, feel free recommending <strong>Bounced</strong > to your friends!
