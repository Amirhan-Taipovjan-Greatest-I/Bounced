# BOUNCED!

### Bounces your Minecraft title as it loads.

**Bounced** does nothing except making your Minecraft titles bounced every time the titles are shown, adding a little vitality to the rigid title screen.

**Bounced** may be too simple to have a config, and if you don't like the animations, just uninstall the mod. Otherwise if you like it, feel free recommending **Bounced** to your friends!
