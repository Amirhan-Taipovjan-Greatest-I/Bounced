# BOUNCED!

**Bounces your Minecraft title as it loads.**

As you've concerned, **Bounced** does nothing except make your Minecraft titles animated through an easing bouncing function, every time the titles are shown.

This mod is too simple to have a config, and if you don't like the animations, just delete the mod. If you like it, feel free recommending **Bounced** to your friends!
